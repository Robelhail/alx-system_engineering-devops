Let me explain some details about this infrastructure:

* A server:- is a computer that provides services or resources to other computers over a network. In this case, the server hosts the website and its components.

* The domain name:- is a human-readable name that identifies the website and maps to its IP address. In this case, foobar.com is the domain name and 8.8.8.8 is the IP address.

* The DNS record:- www is a subdomain of foobar.com that points to the same IP address as the main domain. It is a type of A record that maps a name to an IPv4 address.

* The web server:- is a software that handles incoming HTTP requests from clients and sends back HTTP responses with the requested content. In this case, Nginx is the web server that serves static files (such as HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and passes dynamic requests to the application server.

* The application server:- is a software that runs the application logic and generates dynamic content based on the user input and the database data. In this case, the application server is a PHP interpreter that executes the application files (your code base) and interacts with the database server.

* The database server:- is a software that stores and manages the data for the website. In this case, the database server is MySQL, a relational database management system that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to query and manipulate the data.

* The server uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with the userâ€™s PC. HTTP is a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted over the web. It uses a request-response model, where the client sends a request for a resource and the server sends back a response with the resource or an error message.

Some of the issues with this infrastructure are:

* SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If any component of the web stack fails, such as the server, the web server, the application server, or the database server, the whole website will be unavailable or malfunctioning. There is no redundancy or backup system to ensure high availability and reliability.

* Downtime when maintenance needed: When deploying new code or updating the web server, the application server, or the database server, the website may need to be restarted or taken offline temporarily, which will affect the user experience and cause service interruption.

* Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: If there is a surge in demand or traffic for the website, the single server may not be able to handle all the requests and may become overloaded or slow down. There is no load balancing or horizontal scaling to distribute the workload among multiple servers or instances.
