Let me explain some details about this infrastructure:

* I added a load balancer to distribute the incoming traffic among multiple web servers. This way, the website can handle more requests and avoid overloading a single server. The load balancer also provides high availability by detecting and routing around failed servers.

* I added another web server to increase the capacity and redundancy of the web layer. The web servers are identical and serve the same content. They are configured with Nginx, a web server that can also act as a reverse proxy and cache static files for faster delivery.

* I added another application server to increase the capacity and redundancy of the application layer. The application servers are identical and run the same code base. They are configured with PHP, an application server that can execute dynamic scripts and generate HTML output.

* I added a database cluster to increase the reliability and performance of the data layer. The database cluster consists of a primary node and a replica node. They are configured with MySQL, a relational database management system that uses SQL to query and manipulate the data.

* The load balancer is configured with a round-robin algorithm, which means it distributes the requests evenly among the available web servers in a circular order. For example, if there are two web servers, the first request goes to the first server, the second request goes to the second server, the third request goes back to the first server, and so on. This algorithm is simple and fair, but it does not take into account the load or performance of each server.

* The load balancer enables an active-active setup, which means both web servers are active and can handle requests at any time. This setup provides better performance and scalability than an active-passive setup, which means one web server is active and the other is passive or standby until the active one fails. However, an active-active setup requires more synchronization and coordination among the web servers to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts.

* A database primary-replica cluster works by having one node (the primary) that handles all the write operations (such as insert, update, delete) and replicates them to another node (the replica) that handles all the read operations (such as select). This way, the primary node can offload some of the workload to the replica node and improve the throughput and latency of the database. The replica node also serves as a backup in case the primary node fails or needs maintenance.

* The difference between the primary node and the replica node in regard to the application is that the application server needs to connect to different nodes depending on the type of query it wants to execute. For write queries, it needs to connect to the primary node and wait for the confirmation of the operation. For read queries, it can connect to the replica node and get the result faster. However, the application server also needs to handle the possibility of replication lag, which means the replica node may not have the latest data from the primary node at any given time.

Some of the issues with this infrastructure are:

* SPOF: There are still some components that can cause the whole website to fail if they malfunction, such as the load balancer, the primary node, or the network connection between them. To avoid this, more redundancy and failover mechanisms are needed, such as having multiple load balancers, multiple primary nodes, or multiple network paths.

* Security issues: There is no firewall or HTTPS in this infrastructure, which means the website is vulnerable to attacks and eavesdropping. A firewall is a software or hardware that filters and blocks unwanted or malicious traffic from reaching the server. HTTPS is a protocol that encrypts and secures the communication between the client and the server. To implement these, more configuration and certificates are needed, such as setting up firewall rules, obtaining SSL/TLS certificates, and enabling HTTPS on the web server and the load balancer.

* No monitoring: There is no monitoring system in this infrastructure, which means there is no way to track and measure the performance, availability, and health of each component. A monitoring system is a software or service that collects and analyzes metrics and logs from the server and alerts the administrator in case of any issues or anomalies. To implement this, more tools and integration are needed, such as installing agents, configuring dashboards, and setting up alerts.
